# A Lighter Project Template 

## What is this? 
This prototype is meant to test the assumption that if we reduce the number of folders that a new user is exposed to when they first encounter Kedro, then they will feel less intimiated by the framework and convert into users. 

It features two templates:
- The standard Kedro project template (`kedro-standard`)
- A reduced Kedro project template (`kedro-light`)
